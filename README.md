# Pomodoro CLI
A simple command line Pomodoro timer.

> The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a _pomodoro_, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

### Usage

`go get -u github.com/ihsavru/pomodoro`

  You can pass the following flags to it:

     -longBreak int
        	Duration of long break interval in minutes (default 5)
      -shortBreak int
        	Duration of short break interval in minutes (default 5)
      -work int
        	Duration of work interval in minutes (default 25)
